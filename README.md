This is a Gallery3 module to transfer files from a server directory.  Currently, the naming convention is very rigid.
Source files must be in the format yyyy-mm-xxxxxx.... They will be transfered to a target directory with subdirectories
yyyy followed by mm.

This module takes a lot code from the folder_sync and server_add modules.

Still very much WIP.
